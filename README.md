## About M-Tabs ##
> Moodle Tabs (M-Tabs) is a Moodle course format which renders Moodle course content in a horizontal tabbed format with one section content visible at a time. A ‘Tab’ in the section can be created using Moodle-Tab (M-Tab) Label. M-Tab Label is a modified version of the already existing Moodle resource called ‘Label’. It comprises an icon and a text label.

## How to install M-Tabs? ##
- Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a directory. This will create two directories viz. ‘mtabs’ and ‘mtablabel’
- Copy ‘mtabs’ directory into “<moodle directory>/course/format/” directory.
- Copy ‘mtablabel’ directory into “<moodle directory>/mod/” directory.
- Login to your Moodle site/portal as an Administrator
- A page listing all the plugins installed in the Moodle site/portal will be displayed, asking to install/update Add-on.
- Click on the “Upgrade Moodle database now” button provided at the bottom of the page to start installing the plugin.

Note: *If the plugin installation fails, then you have possibly copied the extracted folder(s) to a wrong location or maybe you are using Moodle version with which M-Tabs is incompatible.*

## How to use M-Tabs in a course? ##
- Login as an Administrator or Teacher or an account with course editing privilege.
- Go to the course where you want to organize the data using M-Tabs
- Add ‘Activity & Resources -> Resources -> M-Tab Label’.
- Select the appropriate icon & provide text to Label. Click ‘Save and return to course’.
- Position the M-Tab Label created, appropriately. This M-Tab Label will be displayed as a Tab and will contain all the resources/activities listed below it until another M-Tab Label is created.
- Turn editing off to view the course in M-Tabs format.

Note:
1. *For better display, use of icons with each M-Tab Label has been made mandatory*
2. *Every Topic/Week in a course should have at least one M-Tab Label*
